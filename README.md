## About the Project
Inspired by the 2024 UEFA European Football Championship in Germany, I have created a small, simple blog web application. On this platform, 
users can share their photos and experiences from the championship, 
as well as comment on posts by others. Visitors to the application can view posts and leave comments.

-Tools: 
PHP OOP, MySQL, HTML5, Bootstrap 4, CSS, JS, JQuery3, API Euro 2024.
